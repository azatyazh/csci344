Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

A 'join' is a way to combine to tables to answer more complex questions, such as data from two or more tables based on a common column like an ID or name. 
Allowing to get related information from different tables in one query. 


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?

You would want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table because it keeps everything consistent. 
Like if you sore the users details in each post you need to update them in multiple places if the user changes something it would lead to the potential errors. 
Foreign key ensures that the users information is soted in one place and could be easily updated across all related posts keeping everything clean and consistent.
